    RoJIT - Made for LuaJIT - Replicates various parts of the Roblox API, All in one file.

    This is meant to be used for *custom* specific scripts. Mostly for POC's and whatnot.
    It will make sure your code runs, so when you translate it to Luau everything goes smooth-sailing.

    Notice: This is a rewritten implementation of Lemur. Code is modified and obviously written in just one file.

--> r_socket is the socket library for luajit
local r_socket do
    local success, socket = pcall(require, "socket")

    if (not success) then
        print("\"socket\" library is required for the following functions:\t\"wait()\"")
        return
    end

    r_socket = socket
end

--> r_type and r_type_mt are used internally, hence why it's not a global variable
--> r_type is the main variable used for setting up types and whatnot.
--> r_type_mt is a direct reference to r_type's metatable
local r_type, r_type_mt do
    r_type = newproxy(true)
    r_type_mt = getmetatable(r_type)
    
    r_type_mt.__tostring = function()

--> typeof - custom function in Roblox, used for advanced types.
--> wait - custom function in Roblox, used for setting up "sleeps"/waits.
